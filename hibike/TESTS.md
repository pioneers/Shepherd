# Running and Writing Tests

Tests are written using Python's `unittest` module. You can read
more about it [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html).
All unit tests are located in the `unit_tests` directory. You can run
them yourself from the
`hibike/` directory with `python3 -m unittest hibike_tests/*.py`.
