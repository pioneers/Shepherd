#  This is a bash function that helps tab-complete the command "./flash.sh" with device names
#  Based heavily on https://debian-administration.org/article/317/An_introduction_to_bash_completion_part_2

#  The install script will copy this file into /etc/bash_completion.d, where it will be get sourced everytime a command window opens up.

#  Due to implimentation, the tab complete will attempt to run anytime "flash.sh" is typed into the command line, and tab hit.
#  This will usually fail, because device names script won't be located.
#  This hopefully won't be too much of a problem, because people won't be running "./flash.sh" when they are going about their day-to-day life on other work.

#
#  Completion for flash.sh:
#
#  flash.sh  [devicename]
#
_flash.sh()
